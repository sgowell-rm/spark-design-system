# Installing Spark

Welcome to the Spark Design System! Here we’ll help you
create digital products with the Rocket Mortgage system of
patterns and components.

To help get you started installing Spark, we created
starter repositories for each of the frameworks you might be using:

* [`spark-starter-html`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html)
* [`spark-starter-angular`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular)
* [`spark-starter-react`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react)

You’ll notice each repository will include a branch highlighting
Spark in various implementation states. Refer to the descriptions
to learn more about each.

| Branch | Description |
|---|---|
| `main` | Design system and prerequisites installed. |
| `kitchen-sink` | Design system and prerequisites installed. Includes test page with components used for testing latest system version. |
| `without-spark` | Boilerplate app without Spark installed. |

Don't forget to check out our installation guides to help walk
you through setting up Spark in different environments!
